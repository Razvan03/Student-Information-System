# Student-Information-System

As the leader of a team consisting of three students, I am working on both the GUI and back-end of a .NET desktop application. The purpose of the application is to enable students to view their school schedules and grades, rate their professors, and allow teachers to add students to the system.

This is a work in progress expected to be finished soon.
